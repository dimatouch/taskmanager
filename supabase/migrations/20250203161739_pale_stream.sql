  # Update task RLS policies with simplified position handling

  1. Changes
    - Simplify RLS policies to allow position updates more freely
    - Remove complex status group checks that were causing issues
    - Maintain basic security while enabling drag-and-drop

  2. Security
    - Keep ownership checks for basic operations
    - Allow position updates for all authenticated users
    - Maintain view restrictions
