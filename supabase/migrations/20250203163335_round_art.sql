  # Fix task permissions for drag and drop functionality

  1. Changes
    - Simplify RLS policies to allow proper drag and drop
    - Remove complex conditions that caused issues
    - Enable proper status updates for all authenticated users
    - Maintain basic security while allowing task management

  2. Security
    - Users can view all tasks (needed for proper drag and drop UI)
    - Users can create tasks they own
    - Users can update any task's status and position (required for drag and drop)
    - Only task owners can delete their tasks

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own tasks" ON tasks;
